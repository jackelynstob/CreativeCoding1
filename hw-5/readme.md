# Fun With Animation

I really enjoyed this weeks homework as well as the content we read. Nothing about it seemed overly complicated for me which is always a relief. I think the videos (while Dan is a bit scatterbrained) are very helpful in learning what to do. His wack-a-doodle self helps keep it from being dull. Like last week, my expectations for myself were a bit high for my knowledge. I had a vision of creating an umbrella-like structure that I could move with my curser, raindrops would fall down and while I moved the umbrella the raindrops would avoid hitting it (as-in, there wouldn't be rain under the umbrella or it obviously wouldn't be doing it's job). I had the fortune to be sitting next to my Dad who actually codes for his job, so as he was explaining how to do that, I realized we just WEREN'T there yet. I'm hoping we will be soon!!

# What I _Could_ Do

I began by doing the first two steps which was to set up my setup function and my draw function. Next I set the background to a neutral black which I put in the function draw so that when my cursor moved, the background would continuously reset, leaving tracers of what my cursor looked like. I then included a triangle that I had rotate every 30 degrees every new frame. For this, multiple steps were necessary to come first.

1. I needed to set a variable for the X coordinate so I could use that in the top point in the triangle
2. I needed to set a variable where the angle was 0, so that when it did rotate, I had something to build off of
3. Color the triangle
4. Create the triangle
5. & lastly update the angle to adjust every 30 degrees

Next I created a sky blue circle that moved with the cursor. This left little tracers while it went. So, what we have so far is:

- A black background
- A spinning orange triangle
- A sky blue circle that moves with the mouse

I wanted to add in the mousePressed function so that the background could reset and the circles would disappear, so I did! I liked my product, but I honestly loved the idea of the changing background color, so I added that in instead of the plain black background. Because of the difference in the background, I struggled with the circles keeping the trace. I tried multiple different things but accepted that the tracers disappeared. I did however keep the mousePressed function for the sake of having it, HAHA!

## In Conclusion

This week was fun, I enjoyed the content and hit all of the criteria. Today I also got braces, so maybe if I wasn't in intense pain, my creative currents would be a lot more in tact. I promise my humor will be back next week, I know you missed in. Au Revoir!
