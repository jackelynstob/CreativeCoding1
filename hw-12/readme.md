# HW 12 | Interacting Objects

## It's the FINALE

I made a mistake by checking out a few people's examples before I got started and that made me very nervous! So many people are so talented it's intimidating! So the beginning of the assignment I worked really hard to try to work some things out but it's just not the way the cookie crumbled for me. So I gave myself a few days and I came back to it with a fresher perspective.

## Sweet Simplicity

I realized my mistake was trying to begin too complex, silly me! That'd never work! So I began with a simple sketch and added layers to it. At first there were just balls bouncing around the screen (what a sight), and then I added a color element to it (red because christmas) and then going off of Shiffman's and Dr. Musick's example, I added a twist that the colors would change to green when they touched.

## Simply Boring

After seeing red and green balls bounce around the screen off of each other, eventually going away, I decided to bring back the festive ball I coded in hw 10. That little guy is cute!!! I had issues with this because I added the ball after my first piece of code in function draw which created a bagillion festive balls which hindered your ability to see the interaction of the balls, so I put it first in the code and that fixed the problem. I also saw a classmates example where the screen went from black to white when clicked and I loved that (pretty sure I've used that a handful of times in different ways) and this concluded my project!!

### Rain and Snow

A poem from me to you:

At the beginning of this course, I was obsessed with the rain,
but soon came Winter and the snow's been on my brain.
My codes were simple and very easy to make.
But as the seasons changed, understanding the material became harder to fake.

Coding for art was something I never dreamed of,
But it's been my favorite class so far, more than all of the above.(hehe)
Thank you for your time, and your generous grading skills,
And for putting up with my puns, I know I can be a pill.
